# Sentiment Analysis on Tripadvisor reviews üõåüèΩüí¨

## Overview

Perform sentiment analysis of textual reviews of hotel stays. The goal is to build a binary classifier able to understand whether the users expressed positive or negative feelings in their comments.

### Dataset

The dataset contains 41077 textual reviews specifically scraped from the tripadvisor.it website. Each review is labeled either positive or negative.

## Implementation 

In the `models.py` has been implemented different classifiers: SVM (linear), RandomForest, Naive Bayes Classifiers (Multinomial). During training an hyperparameter search is performed.
In order to limit the effect of the unbalanced dataset (i.e. overfitting) for the training and validation phase a cross-validation approach was used, specifically with the implementation of Scikit-learn‚Äôs `KFold` class. The approach divides all the samples in groups of subsamples and consequently the prediction function was learned using k-1 folds and the fold left out was used for test. The default value for the number of folds was set to 10.

The selection of the best model was done experimentally by using the different parameters, such as the number of features, the choice of tokenization (unigrams and bigrams), the use of a normalizer etc.

## Results

Overall the **best accuracy 0.9694** was obtained using *Linear SVM* with stemmer and token unigrams plus bigrams as features and emoticons replacement as pre-processing technique. The main related issue was that with SVM was not performed aggressive feature selection.
